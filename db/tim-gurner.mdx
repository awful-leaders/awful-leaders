```
I think the problem that we've had is that we've you know we we have people decided they didn't really want
to work so much anymore through covert and that has had a massive issue on productivity you know tradies have
definitely pulled back on productivity you know they they have been paid up paid a lot to do not too much in the
last few years and we need to see that change we need to see unemployment rise unemployment has to jump 40 50 in my
view we need to see pain in the economy we need to remind people that they work for the employer not the other way
around I mean there is a there's been a systematic change where employees feel the employer is extremely lucky to have
them as opposed to the other way around so it's a dynamic that has to change we've got to kill that attitude and that
has to come through hurting the economy which is what the whole Global you know the the world is trying to do the
governments around the world are trying to increase unemployment to get that to some sort of normality and we're
seeing it I think every employer now is seeing it I mean there is definitely massive layoffs going on for people
might not be talking about it but people are definitely laying people off and we're starting to see less arrogance in
the employment market and that has to continue because that will Cascade across the cost balance
