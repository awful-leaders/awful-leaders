# How to contribute

## Contribute anonymously

There are largely two ways to do this:

  1. Create an anonymous GitHub account. And contribute via that account.
  1. Use [GitMask](https://www.gitmask.com/) or equivalent service to strip off all identifying metadata.

## Ways to contribute

### Add missing awful leaders

{/* The backtick `code` breaks things! Figure out why! */}

Simply create a new .mdx file under db/ directory, and add it to the components/awful-leaders-list.tsx file.

### Add missing data for an existing awful leader profile

Find relevant file under the db/ directory, and add missing data.
